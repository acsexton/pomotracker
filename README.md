# Pomotracker
A python-based [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer with time-tracking aspirations.

## What it is
It counts down and plays a sound! See the link above.

## Use
* Install playsound (`$ pip3 install playsound`)
* Clone the repo
* Run the script (`$ python3 ./pomotracker.py`)
* It'll ask what kind of cycle you'd like
* Make a selection and get to work
* When the bell goes off, you can take a break. Goes off again, get back to work, and so on.

## Timer Selections
* Standard Cycle: Runs three 25-minute work sessions, each with a 5-minute break, then gives a 15 minute break
* Short break: Runs a 5-minute timer 
* Long break: Runs a 15-minute timer
* Test: Runs a 5-second timer (just to make sure the bell works)
* Q to quit
